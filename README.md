I've written a custom dotfile manager to help me use this repo on multiple computers. It's not super user friendly yet and I prototyped it in elixir, so you'll have to install that (asdf recommended).

If you don't want to bother with that, you can delete the blocks that start with `#tags` and end with `#end` and just use `stow` on individual directories.
